// Object literal syntax creates a single object, but factory functions offer a reusable way to generate objects 
// with the same state and behavior (properties and methods).
// However, constructor functions are more commonly used for this purpose.
// Constructor functions initialize an object's state and are named using PascalCase.
// The 'this' keyword is used within the constructor to define properties and methods for the object.
