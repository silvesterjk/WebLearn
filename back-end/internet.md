TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is a set of protocols that define how computers communicate with each other on the internet.

**How it works**: TCP/IP breaks data into packets, assigns each packet an IP address, and routes them to their destination.Â TCP is responsible for breaking down and reassembling packets, while IP handles routing and addressing.

* IP v4 == #.#.#.#
	* 4 bytes or 32 bits --> 4 billions
* IP v6 is already being used and is of 128 bits.

IP mandates source address and the destination address. Similar to physical address.

TCP guarantees delivery. Such as 1/2 and 2/2. Only upon getting both the packets, the transfer is complete. 

TCP also provides ports. Such as 80 for HTTP (web) and HTTPS (secure web).
