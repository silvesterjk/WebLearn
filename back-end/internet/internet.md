TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is a set of protocols that define how computers communicate with each other on the internet.

**How it works**: TCP/IP breaks data into packets, assigns each packet an IP address, and routes them to their destination. TCP is responsible for breaking down and reassembling packets, while IP handles routing and addressing.

* IP v4 == #.#.#.#
	* 4 bytes or 32 bits --> 4 billions
* IP v6 is already being used and is of 128 bits.

IP mandates source address and the destination address. Similar to physical address.

TCP guarantees delivery. Such as 1/2 and 2/2. Only upon getting both the packets, the transfer is complete. 

TCP also provides ports. Such as 80 for HTTP (web) and 443 for HTTPS (secure web).

DNS stands for Domain Name System which is a system that translates human readable domain names into IP addresses that machines can understand. - DNS maintains the domain name hierarchy and translates between it and IP address spaces.

example.com ---> 111.111.111.111:80

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other configuration information to devices on a network.


HTTP and HTTPS:  They are both protocols for transferring data over the internet, but HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP. 

Stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and it's the underlying technology that allows browsers to communicate with web servers. When you visit a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server, which responds with an HTTP response. 

Stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, and it's an extension of HTTP that uses encryption to make data transfer more secure. HTTPS encrypts the information being sent between the browser and the server, including the URL path, post bodies, and query string parameters.
