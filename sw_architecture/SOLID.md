S -- Single Responsibility Principle (A class should have single responsibility) which does not mean single task, all the functionalities need to be closely related.
O -- Open Closed (Open to extension and closed to modification) // By using a decorator or extension maybe.
L -- Liskov Substitution (A child class should be able to do everything a parent class can -- To enable this we need to have Human class branching out to parent and child seperately)
I -- Inteface Segregation (All methods needs to be used)
D -- Dependency Inversion (high level modules should not depend on lower level modules. Both should depend on abstraction.)
