* A case where: Person A sends a message to Person B specifying the MAC address. 
	* A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique 48-bit identifier assigned to network interface cards (NICs) used for device identification on physical networks. It consists of 12 hexadecimal digits (like 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E), where the first half identifies the manufacturer (OUI) and the second half is a unique device identifier. MAC addresses operate at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model and are essential for local network communications.
	* While MAC addresses are permanently burned into hardware during manufacturing, they can be spoofed for various purposes. They're crucial for local network operations, including device identification, DHCP assignments, and network security through MAC filtering. However, unlike IP addresses, MAC addresses only work for communication within local networks and aren't used for routing data across the internet.

* Supposing that everyone in the network will get the message but only person B will accept it.
	* This is both inefficient and insecure. 
	* In case of wifi for example, everyone will get the MAC address causing a potential security breach.
* Thus we need to eliminate the need to send to everyone and the address needs to get better.
* We need to route this via something and that is the IP address. Which is built in two parts:
	* One part to identify the network, the other is the host.
	* We use the network portion to eliminate many networks.
	* The host part is used to find the host. Which still needs a MAC address.
