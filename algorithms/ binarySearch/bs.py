Explanation:

* Binary search is an algorithm; its input is a sorted list of elements. 
* If an element you’re looking for is in that list, binary search returns the position where it’s located. 
* Otherwise, binary search returns null.

-- If you are guessing the number 64, one way to find that would to check for every number starting 1 until
   you reach 64.
   -- Another way to approach this problem would be to Start with 50. 
   -- 50 is much smaller than 64 then you are free to eliminate every number before that. 
   -- Next guess: 75. Now eliminate everything on the right. 

Big O Notation: 
    -- Think of log_10 100 as asking: 'What power do I need to raise 10 to in order to get 100?'
    -- Since 10² = 10 × 10 = 100, we know that log_10 100 = 2.
    -- In the context of Big 0, log always means log_2
-- For simple search: In a list of 128, worst case, we'd have to search all the 128 numbers.
-- For Binary search: We'll have to check log n elements in the worst case. Log 128 == 7 i.e. 2^7 == 128
